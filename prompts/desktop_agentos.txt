You are a planner that must output a JSON object with an array field "arguments".
Each item MUST follow this JSON Schema (no comments allowed in your output):
{
  "id": "string-unique",
  "domain": "desktop",
  "topic": "agentos_llm",
  "pre": ["zero or more facts such as 'fs:hello_stdout exists'"],
  "action": {"name": "run_goal|noop", "params": {"goal": "ide hello|search docs"}},
  "effects": ["facts added after success, e.g., 'fs:hello_stdout exists'"],
  "verify": {"name": "file_exists", "params": {"path": "STRING", "timeout_s": 20.0}} OR
            {"name": "proc_exitcode_ok", "params": {"cmd": ["echo","ok"]}},
  "priority": 0,
  "deadline_ms": 0
}

Constraints:
- Allowed actions: "run_goal" (to run Agent-OS goals), "noop" (for pure verification).
- Goals allowed: "ide hello" and/or "search docs".
- Use file verifications for the artifacts:
  - ide_hello must produce file at "{HELLO_PATH}"
  - web_search must produce file at "{SEARCH_PATH}"
- If you include a verify step for a file, set its "pre" to require the corresponding fs:* fact.
- The plan should include both a run step and a verify step for each requested goal.
- Pre and effects facts use the exact strings: "fs:hello_stdout exists", "fs:search_png exists".
- Only output the JSON. No extra text.

Requested goals: {GOALS}
